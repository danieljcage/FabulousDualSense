# Fabulous DualSense

Input device plugin for the **DualSense** controller on **Windows** for **Unreal Engine**.

This plugin includes generic gamepad, touchpad, and gyroscope functionality, as well as partial support for the [Device Properties](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/device-properties-in-unreal-engine/) feature (supported device properties are **Device Color**, **Trigger Feedback**, and **Trigger Resistance**).

**This plugin is intended for use during development only**. Consider using the **Windows DualShock** or **Game Input (Windows)** plugins instead in shipping builds.
